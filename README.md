# Domain Redirection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/redirect-service.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
cd redirection-mx
bun install
```

3. Ensure you have an `redirects.xlsx` file in the project root directory, containing the redirect rules.

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```
bun run src/index.ts
```

2. The server will listen on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Any requests to the server will be checked against the redirect rules in the Excel file. If a matching rule is found, the user will be redirected to the specified destination URL with the configured status code (default is 301 Moved Permanently).

4. If no matching rule is found, a 404 Not Found response will be returned.

## API

The server exposes a single route that handles all incoming requests:

- `GET /*` - Checks the incoming request against the redirect rules and either redirects the user or returns a 404 response.
